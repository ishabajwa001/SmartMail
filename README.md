🛠 Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Streamlit

Google Gemini (google-generativeai)

Gmail IMAP (fetch)

Gmail SMTP (send)

python-dotenv

Local JSON persistence

🔐 Authentication

SmartMail uses:

Gmail App Password (IMAP + SMTP)

Google Gemini API Key

OAuth is not implemented in this version due to cloud billing requirements.
This tool is intended for personal deployment. Do not commit .env or credentials to GitHub.

⚠️ Limitations

Designed for single-user use

No OAuth authentication

Free-tier Gemini rate limits apply

Local JSON read-state resets on Streamlit Cloud restart

Not optimized for very large inboxes

Credentials are stored locally via .env or Streamlit secrets

🧪 Resource Optimization

Email body truncation before AI analysis

Model fallback logic

Controlled email fetch size

Draft regeneration only when requested

▶️ Setup
1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SmartMail.git
cd SmartMail
2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure environment (Local / Optional)

Create a .env file if running locally:

EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

For Streamlit deployment, use Streamlit Secrets instead of .env.

4. Run locally
streamlit run agent.py

Open: http://localhost:8501

🌍 Deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud)

Push project to GitHub (public repository)

Go to Streamlit Share

Click New app → select repository → main file: agent.py

Open Secrets tab and add credentials in TOML format:

EMAIL = "your_email@gmail.com"
APP_PASSWORD = "your_app_password"
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key"

Click Deploy

The app now runs safely without exposing credentials in your repository.
